# SRGEN

A Shadowrun 4 character generator.

## State

This project is very much work in progress and currently pretty far from being
useful for any real use case.

## Data Files

Data files (anything in the `data/` directory) from the excellent 
[Chummer Project](http://chummergen.com/) are used with permission.
Note that these data files are not copyrighted by me and are *not* released
under the MIT license (which applies to the rest of the source code of this
project).
